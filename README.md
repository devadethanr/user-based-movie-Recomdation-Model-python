DESCRIPTION

Analysis Task
- Exploratory Data Analysis:

•	Which movies have maximum views/ratings?
•	What is the average rating for each movie? Define the top 5 movies with the maximum ratings.
•	Define the top 5 movies with the least audience.

Three main works done on this dataset to provide this model


•	Divide the data into training and test data.
•	Build a recommendation model on training data.
•	Make predictions on the test data.


Dataset contains user reviews it provided enough data for training model

Data Dictionary
UserID – 4848 customers who provided a rating for each movie
Movie 1 to Movie 206 – 206 movies for which ratings are provided by 4848 distinct users

Data Considerations
- all users have not yet watched all the movies, I assumed the missing data as N/A values 
- Ratings are on a scale of -1 to 10 where -1 is the least rating and 10 is the best.
